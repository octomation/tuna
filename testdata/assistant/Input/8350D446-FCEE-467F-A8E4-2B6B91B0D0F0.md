Dear Mr. Johnson,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to follow up on our meeting last Thursday regarding the quarterly budget review. As discussed, we need to finalize the allocation for the marketing department by the end of this week.

Please let me know if you require any additional documentation.

Best regards,
Sarah Mitchell
